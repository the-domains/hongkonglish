Word Origin & History

a difficult word to trace, in part because it was initially due to the poor English standards of Hong Kong. Hence, Hong Kong People tend to code-mix Cantonese and other Chinese Dialects into the English Language. Very similar to Singapore's dialect, Singlish, Hong Konglish has its unique feature where not only does it code-mix cantonese terms or slangs into the English Language, it also

has a whole new pronunciation system.
